                        techniques. I love
                        structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details
                        and optimizing
                        web apps. Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes:

                        better than one'. </p>

                                as business and social impact challenges. This course thought me about the mechanisms
                                of gamification, why it
                                has such tremendous potential, and how to use it effectively. </p>

                                personal social life. As this idea didn't exactly take off the way we expected it to,
                                we changed the idea. We
                                began a job matching platform, where Whoopaa became the place for job seekers to make

                                user experience and speed after the big idea change. I also developed the real time

                                Right after I graduated, I started working for C2K: a full service internet agency. I
                                developed a homemade CMS,
                                CRM and e-mail marketing system. The CMS was used for a dozens of clients, as well as
                                the e-mail marketing
                                system. I also did a lot of custom made web sites/applications. Later on I also
                                developed Layars like: Conquar
                                (a digital adaption of the board game of Risk) and Gowalla (based on Gowalla's API).
                                C2K no longer exists. </p>

                                My second internship and the place I eventually graduated, was at Davinci. I
                                investigated new web-technologies
                                they could possibly use to improve the front-end of their java-based CRM system. I
                                compared technologies such as
                                Adobe Flex, Silverlight, Ruby on Rails together, to find out which could work best for
                                the company. Based on the
                                results of my research, the company eventually decided to use the ZK Framework. </p>
